PhD Candidate at the Department of Physics and Astronomy | Purdue University
======

I am an incoming fifth year PhD candidate at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Purdue University. I work on astrophysical transients specifically supernovae under supervision of [Dr. Danny Milisavljevic](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/milisavljevic/people.html) in the exciting [Time Domain Astrophysics Group](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/milisavljevic/index.html). My research primarily focuses on developing statistical inference techniques to extract science of explosion parameters from sparse supernova light-curves. Our Group at Purdue has been developing a novel state-of-the-art transient classification and strategy engine called the Recommender Engine for Intelligent Transient Tracking [(REFITT)]()https://refitt.physics.purdue.edu/, an artificial intelligence system that autonomously designs optimal observing strategies in real time using advanced machine learning techniques to confront the Big Data Challenge (with upcoming Rubin Observatory LSST Survey) in the field of astronomy.
