I’m currently a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at **[Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/)** at the **[University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/)**, working with **Prof. [Dave Sand](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty)** to study **young, nearby supernovae** and investigate the formation of **dust in core-collapse supernova (CCSNe) ejecta**. Using the powerful capabilities of the **[James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://jwst.nasa.gov/)**, my research is focused on understanding these energetic explosions and their impact on dust production in the universe.

Before joining University of Arizona, I completed my **Ph.D. in Astrophysics** at **[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)** under the supervision of **[Dr. Danny Milisavljevic](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/milisavljevic/people.html)**. As part of Purdue’s **[Time Domain Astrophysics Group](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/milisavljevic/index.html)**, I worked on developing advanced **statistical inference techniques** to extract explosion parameters from sparse supernova light curves from all-sky surveys. Through innovative data analysis methods, we developed a real-time inferencing system that uses hydrodynamical models and statistical sampling methods to derive physics of these explosiosn.
I contributed to the development of the **[Recommender Engine for Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT)](https://refitt.physics.purdue.edu/)**—an AI-driven system designed to optimize observing strategies and follow-up decisions on transients from all-sky surveys in real time. REFITT is designed to address the **Big Data challenge** of the upcoming **[Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/)**, helping to ensure that the scientific capabilities of the survey are fully maximized enhancing time-domain astronomy.

Beyond my academic work, I’m passionate about **programming, data science**, and the application of **machine learning** in astronomy. I’m also a strong advocate for **women and underrepresented groups** in **STEM**, and I take pride in participating in **leadership roles** that promote diversity and inclusion in science.

As a **South Indian** from **Kerala**, I enjoy balancing my scientific work with hobbies like **traveling, working out, running, playing volleyball**, and **cooking**—all of which keep me inspired and grounded.
