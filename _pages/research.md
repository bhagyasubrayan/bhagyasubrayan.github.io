<p> AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie; aka "Scary Barbie") is the largest cosmic accretion event ever witnessed. From a spectroscopically measured redshift of 0.995, AT2021lwx emit a peak-observed pseudo-bolometric luminosity of log(L/[erg/s]) = 45.7 from slowly fading ztf-g and ztf-r light curves spanning over 1000 observer-frame days. Optical spectra exhibit strong emission lines with narrow cores from the H Balmer series and ultraviolet semi-forbidden lines of Si III] λ1892, C III] λ1909, and  C II] λ2325. Typical nebular lines in Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) spectra from ions such as [O II] and [O III] are not detected. These spectral features, along with the smooth light curve that is unlike most AGN flaring activity and the luminosity that exceeds any observed or theorized supernova, lead us to conclude that AT2021lwx is most likely an extreme tidal disruption event (TDE). Modeling of ZTF photometry with MOSFiT suggests that the TDE was between a ≈14 solar mass star and a supermassive black hole of mass ∼ 10<sup>8</sup> solar masses. No host galaxy for AT2021lwx is detected yet. </p> <br>
