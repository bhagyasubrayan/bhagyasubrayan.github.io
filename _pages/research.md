<h2> Multiwavelength observations and characterization of the ultraluminous transient AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie; aka " Scary Barbie") </h2>

<p> AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie; aka "Scary Barbie") is the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/12/largest-space-explosion-scary-barbie-black-hole/70212322007/" style="text-decoration:none">largest cosmic accretion event</a> ever witnessed. From a spectroscopically measured redshift of 0.995, we reported that AT2021lwx emit a peak-observed pseudo-bolometric luminosity of log(L/[erg/s]) = 45.7 from slowly fading ztf-g and ztf-r light curves spanning over 1000 observer-frame days. Optical spectra exhibit strong emission lines with narrow cores from the H Balmer series and ultraviolet semi-forbidden lines of Si III] λ1892, C III] λ1909, and  C II] λ2325. Typical nebular lines in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" style="text-decoration:none"> Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) </a> spectra from ions such as [O II] and [O III] are not detected. These spectral features, along with the smooth light curve that is unlike most AGN flaring activity and the luminosity that exceeds any observed or theorized supernova, lead us to conclude that AT2021lwx is most likely an extreme <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event" style = "text-decoration:none">tidal disruption event (TDE)</a>. Modeling of ZTF photometry with MOSFiT suggests that the TDE was between a ≈14 solar mass star and a supermassive black hole of mass ∼ 10<sup>8</sup> solar masses. No host galaxy for AT2021lwx is detected yet. </p>

<h2> Science-Driven Forecasts for Follow-up observations of All-Sky Survey Transients with REFITT</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;max-width:100%;margin-right:15px;padding-bottom:-10px;display:block;float:left;vertical-align:top"><img src="https://bsubraya.github.io/images/Science_Follow_up.png" alt="Characterization of transients." data-api-endpoint="https://bsubraya.github.io/images/Science_Follow_up.png" data-api-returntype="File" /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Left: REFITT utilizes grids of core-collapse simulations to make on-the-fly characterizations of transients. Model parameters (e.g., kinetic energy, mass loss rate, ,<sup>56</sup>Ni mass, ejecta mass) can then be used to guide decision-making based on scientific objectives. Right: Follow-up observations of Type II event ZTF22aaacxkp at valuable epochs (shown in diamonds) in multiple filters by observing agents at Supra
Solem Observing (SSO) using recommendations provided by REFITT (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca80a" style="text-decoration: none">Subrayan+ 2023</a>). </span></p>

<p>The Recommender Engine for Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) is an artificial intelligence system that prioritizes and recommends follow-up observations of transients based on science-driven objectives such as characterizing key explosion parameters (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab8128" style="text-decoration: none">Sravan+ 2020</a>). Theoretically-driven forecasts of transients can be leveraged to strategize follow up observations to optimally achieve scientific objectives from all-sky surveys. Prioritizing the underlying physics of transients will make it possible to 1) rapidly recognize transients of desired physical parameter spaces, and 2) identify information-rich epochs in transient evolution for efficient follow-up with limited facilities. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca80a" style="text-decoration: none">Subrayan+ 2023</a> demonstrated that pre-computed hydrodynamical model grids (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/pasj/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pasj/psad024/7140554" style="text-decoration: none">Moriya+ 2023</a>) along with statistical analyses can provide opportunities to enhance scientific return from all-sky surveys that provide live alert streams. Hence, real-time characterization of transients can be incorporated into TOMs to make forecasts that can efficiently recommend targets for follow-up at information-rich epochs.</p>
