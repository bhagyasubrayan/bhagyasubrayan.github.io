</p>
<p> I was thrilled and immensely grateful to have had the wonderful opportunity to be a guest on the esteemed NPR 1A podcast, where I had the privilege to discuss our latest work on AT2021lwx aka "Scary Barbie." It was an unforgettable experience to share our research and insights with such a wide audience. The experience deepened my appreciation for the importance of science communication, bridging the gap between research and the general public.

</p>
<p> During the exciting times surrounding the launch of JWST, Purdue Department of Physics and Astronomy hosted a <a href="https://express.adobe.com/page/O66xeEfENAb9R/?_ga=2.43759777.541119511.1684420215-1579954978.1679585061" style = "text-decoration:none">virtual launch party </a> where I was invited to serve as the Master of Ceremony. I moderated a panel of 6 science experts sharing enthusiasm and excitement about the JWST launch and its science. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzqsDOQoZ1w&feature=youtu.be" style="text-decoration:none">launch party</a> was streamed live on YouTube. Later, the department hosted another public outreach program following the first release of images from JWST. I was given the opportunity to serve as as a co-MC for this outreach.

</p>

<p>I gave a talk on Astro On Tap -- Cradle of Astronauts sharing my passion for astronomy and the incredible possibilities offered by the JWST. Engaging with the enthusiastic audience and discussing the upcoming advancements of the JWST opened my eyes to the importance of conveying complex scientific concepts in an accessible and engaging manner.</p><br>

</p>

<p> I am a volunteer at the Saturday Morning Astrophysics at Purdue (SMAP) where will ignite passion for astrophysics and nurture the next generation of scientific thinkers and explorers. We work with middle and high school students in grades 7-12 diving into current topics in astro research, historical background and discovery, and fundamental principles related to physics and astronomy. During pandemic, I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imOoTtWWatE&t=160s&ab_channel=SaturdayMorningAstrophysicsatPurdue" style="text-decoration:none">virtual </a> lesson on Stellarium with Jack Reynolds. </p><br>
