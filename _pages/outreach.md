<h2>Promoting Science through Communication and Public Engagement</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;max-width:45%;margin-left:20px;padding-bottom:-50px;display:block;float:right;vertical-align:top"><img src="https://bsubraya.github.io/images/NPR1A.jpeg" alt="NPR 1A podcast" data-api-endpoint="https://bsubraya.github.io/images/NPR1A.jpeg" data-api-returntype="File" /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Minutes berfore live on air for <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510316/1a" style="text-decoration:none">Nationa Public Radio (NPR) 1A </a> podcast with my supervisor Dr. Danny Milisavljevic</span>
</p>
<p> I was thrilled and immensely grateful to have had the wonderful opportunity to be a guest on the esteemed NPR 1A podcast, where I had the privilege to discuss our latest work on AT2021lwx aka "Scary Barbie." It was an unforgettable experience to share our research and insights with such a wide audience. The experience deepened my appreciation for the importance of science communication, bridging the gap between research and the general public.

</p>
<p> During the exciting times surrounding the launch of JWST, Purdue Department of Physics and Astronomy hosted a <a href="https://express.adobe.com/page/O66xeEfENAb9R/?_ga=2.43759777.541119511.1684420215-1579954978.1679585061" style = "text-decoration:none">virtual launch party </a> where I was invited to serve as the Master of Ceremony. I moderated a panel of 6 science experts sharing enthusiasm and excitement about the JWST launch and its science. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzqsDOQoZ1w&feature=youtu.be" style="text-decoration:none">launch party</a> was streamed live on YouTube. Later, the department hosted another public outreach program following the first release of images from JWST. I was given the opportunity to serve as as a co-MC for this outreach.

</p>

<p>I gave a talk on Astro On Tap -- Cradle of Astronauts sharing my passion for astronomy and the incredible possibilities offered by the JWST. Engaging with the enthusiastic audience and discussing the upcoming advancements of the JWST opened my eyes to the importance of conveying complex scientific concepts in an accessible and engaging manner. It highlighted the power of storytelling and visuals in capturing the imagination and inspiring a sense of wonder about the universe.</p><br>

</p>

<p> I am a volunteer at the Saturday Morning Astrophysics at Purdue (SMAP) where will ignite passion for astrophysics and nurture the next generation of scientific thinkers and explorers. We work with middle and high school students in grades 7-12 diving into current topics in astro research, historical background and discovery, and fundamental principles related to physics and astronomy. During pandemic, I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imOoTtWWatE&t=160s&ab_channel=SaturdayMorningAstrophysicsatPurdue" style="text-decoration:none">virtual </a> lesson on Stellarium with Jack Reynolds. </p>

<h2>Leadership and Service</h2>

</p>

<p> Passionately supporting women and underrepresented groups in STEM, I am driven to break down barriers and create a more inclusive scientific community. <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/science/wisp/graduate/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">WISP</a> stands for Women in Science Program. A platform for graduate students across STEM fields at Purdue could network, support and help each other succeed in their careers. We plan a series of monthly events with invited speakers throughout an academic year on life-skills/ science based topics. I served as the Graduate WISP Leadership Member and liasion for the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 2020-2023 mentoring and supporting undergraduate and graduate women in STEM fields at Purdue. </p>

</p>

<p> Serving as the President of <a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/pgsa/about/index.php" style="text-decoration:none">Physics Graduate Student Association(PGSA)</a> for the year 2022-23, I was elated to foster a strong community in graduate school. We provided invaluable resources and support for graduate students, from professional development to social events and academic assistance. The experience taught me the importance of listening to the diverse voices of graduate students and striving to create an environment that fosters growth, friendships and a sense of belonging.</p>
